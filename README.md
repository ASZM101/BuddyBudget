# 💸 BuddyBudget 💸

## ✨ Inspiration ✨
We have noticed that a lot of people in today's society, particularly teenagers, are financially illiterate and lack the skills and discipline to save and spend their money wisely. Therefore, we decided to create **BuddyBudget** as a solution to this problem.

## 🤖 What It Does 🤖
**BuddyBudget** features a budget tracker to help you with your financial goals by keeping track of all of your savings and expenses. Additionally, the app comes equipped with a learning hub containing financial literacy articles to teach you fundamental financial literacy skills and short quizzes to test your newly acquired knowledge.

## 🏗 How We Built It 🏗
We used Swift UI to build a simple yet powerful and visually appealing frontend for iOS devices. We also wrote a backend in Rust to deploy a REST API quickly and efficiently using Rocket.

## 👀 What's Next? 👀
In the future of **BuddyBudget**, we hope to make this highly useful tool available to a wider range of platforms, as well as expand our learning hub by writing more articles and creating more quizzes.

## 👨‍💻 How to Run 👨‍💻
Requirements:

- MacOS version >= 13.5.1
- Xcode version >= 15.0
- `rustc` version >= 1.74.1
