## ✨ Inspiration ✨
We were thinking about how a lot of people in today's society are financially illiterate. We created **BuddyBudget** as a solution to this problem.

## 🤖 What It Does 🤖
**BuddyBudget** is a budget tracker that also has short articles that help you on your financial goals.

## 🏗 How We Built It 🏗
We used Swift UI to build a simple yet powerful frontend for iOS devices. We also wrote a backend in Rust to deploy a REST API quickly and efficiently using Rocket.

## 👀 What's Next? 👀
In the future of **BuddyBudget**, we hope to expand to more platforms, as well as write more articles.

## 👨‍💻 How to Run 👨‍💻
Requires:

- MacOS
- rustc version >=1.74.1
- cargo version >=1.74.1

Install and run the XCode project. Then, in a separate folder, start the Rocket server.
